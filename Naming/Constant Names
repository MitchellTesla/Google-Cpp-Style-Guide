Variables declared constexpr or const, and whose value is fixed for the duration of the program, are named with a leading "k" followed by mixed case. Underscores can be used as separators in the rare cases where capitalization cannot be used for separation. For example:

const int kDaysInAWeek = 7;
const int kAndroid8_0_0 = 24;  // Android 8.0.0
All such variables with static storage duration (i.e., statics and globals, see Storage Duration for details) should be named this way. This convention is optional for variables of other storage classes, e.g., automatic variables, otherwise the usual variable naming rules apply.
