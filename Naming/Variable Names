The names of variables (including function parameters) and data members are all lowercase, with underscores between words. Data members of classes (but not structs) additionally have trailing underscores. For instance: a_local_variable, a_struct_data_member, a_class_data_member_.

Common Variable names
For example:

std::string table_name;  // OK - lowercase with underscore.
std::string tableName;   // Bad - mixed case.
Class Data Members
Data members of classes, both static and non-static, are named like ordinary nonmember variables, but with a trailing underscore.

class TableInfo {
  ...
 private:
  std::string table_name_;  // OK - underscore at end.
  static Pool<TableInfo>* pool_;  // OK.
};
Struct Data Members
Data members of structs, both static and non-static, are named like ordinary nonmember variables. They do not have the trailing underscores that data members in classes have.

struct UrlTableProperties {
  std::string name;
  int num_entries;
  static Pool<UrlTableProperties>* pool;
};
See Structs vs. Classes for a discussion of when to use a struct versus a class.
