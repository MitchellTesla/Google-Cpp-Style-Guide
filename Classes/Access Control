Make classes' data members private, unless they are constants. This simplifies reasoning about invariants, at the cost of some easy boilerplate in the form of accessors (usually const) if necessary.

For technical reasons, we allow data members of a test fixture class defined in a .cc file to be protected when using Google Test). If a test fixture class is defined outside of the .cc file it is used in, for example in a .h file, make data members private.
